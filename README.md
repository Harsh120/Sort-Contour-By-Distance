# Sort-Contour-By-Distance

Many times we want to sort the contours as the same as the sequence we write. For that built-in function for CV2 does not help that much.
For sorting it in a correct manner we calculate distance of each contours.

These is my test image:

Creating contours it will look like this:

After using 'sorted' functon of CV2 I got this:

But that's not what we want, that's why I make my own alogrithm to sort it by distance
